## TabOrganizer
The **TabOrganizer** extension is designed to help users efficiently manage their open tabs in the Chrome browser. Here’s a breakdown of its main functionalities:

### Main Features

1. **Tab Grouping**:
   - When the user clicks the "Group Tabs" button, the extension collects all open tabs in the current window and groups them based on their domain (e.g., all tabs from example.com will be grouped together).

2. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The extension provides a clean and responsive user interface, built with Bootstrap, making it easy to use on different devices.

3. **Dynamic Theme Support**:
   - It automatically adapts to the user’s system theme (light or dark mode), enhancing the user experience.

4. **Quick Access to Tabs**:
   - Once the tabs are grouped, users can easily access and navigate between them directly from the extension popup, which lists the grouped tabs with clickable links.

### Potential Use Cases

- **Reducing Clutter**: For users who frequently have many tabs open, grouping them helps reduce clutter and improves organization.
- **Improving Productivity**: By organizing tabs by domain, users can quickly find related resources, making it easier to switch between tasks.
- **Session Management**: Users can see all their tabs organized by project or topic, which can help in managing ongoing work.

### Future Enhancements

While the initial version provides basic functionality, there are several potential enhancements you could consider for future updates:

- **Saving Tab Groups**: Allow users to save their tab groups for later access.
- **Customizable Grouping**: Provide options for users to define how tabs are grouped (e.g., by title, custom tags).
- **Tab Management Features**: Include features to close, reopen, or pin grouped tabs directly from the extension.
- **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to quickly filter through grouped tabs.

Overall, the **TabOrganizer** extension serves as a simple yet effective tool for managing browser tabs, enhancing user experience and productivity. If you have specific functionalities in mind or want to expand its capabilities, feel free to share!
